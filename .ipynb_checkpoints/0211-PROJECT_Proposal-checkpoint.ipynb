    "- **Milestone 1: Project Proposals** - (This assignment) Overview of what you would like to do for your projects.  What software will you explore, what science problem you will solve and what are the expected outcomes. Also the creation of a git repository. \n",
    "- **Milestone 2: Software Exploration** - You will explore software NOT covered in this course. Software may include a library, programming language, hardware, scientific code, etc).  The project will require you to learn about the software, get it installed and working on the HPC (or equivalent) and write up a short tutorial with examples with enough details so that your peers can get it up and running).  See [0325-PROJECT_Part1](0325-PROJECT_Part1.ipynb) for more information.\n",
    "- **Milestone 3: Benchmark and Optimization** - You will identify an existing scientific/engineering problem that currently runs slow.  You will either write a new program form scratch or modify an existing code to run in parallel.  You may also modify an existing parallel code to run in parallel faster.   You may, but are not required to use the software you explored in milestone 2 of the project. See [0415-PROJECT_Part2](0415-PROJECT_Part2.ipynb) for more information.\n",

    "The domain I will be covering is computational biology, specifically gene research. Computation is used in the field of biology to develop algorithms and models that help scientists understand relationships and systems. I am currently a member of the Krishnan Lab research group, where fellow post docs, professors, and undergrads work together to build computational applications that further the study of biology. Because of the experience I've gained from working with this lab group and learning the technical skills that concern computational biology, in addition to my interest in the research that this group does, I felt compelled to use a piece of software that my lab group authored as the subject software of my project. After discussion, I decided to use a software that was published as part of a paper recently, called Expresto, and is essentially used to predict the gene expression profiles of partially measured microarray samples. One of the paper's authors proposed I benchmark a specific regression algorithm used in this software (which I'll discuss further below), since the testing stage of this algorithm is very costly in terms of space and time to process. I plan to use the HPCC to test/benchmark this code, which is fortunately written in python. I hope to speed up the testing process, which is currently very slow to run since it creates a separate model for every testing sample. I would consider this successful if I am able to parallelize or simply improve the algorithm to run faster in any way."

    "\n",
    "&#9989;  Provide a more detailed paragraph about the software you are going to review for the first part of the assignment.  Again this will vary based on project but provide any links (references) and information on where you plan to start.  Also descrbe what you expect as the outcome of this step.  Will you have a list of instructions for running the code on the HPC or maybe a folder in a format compatible with ```getexample```?\n",
    "\n",
    "The software I am going to review is called Expresto, which uses a regression algorithm called SampleLASSO to impute gene expression profiles for microarray samples. The SampleLASSO algorithm is based on the commonly known LASSO regression analysis algorithm, a regression analysis method that minimizes the sum of squared errors, performing both variable selection and regularization, which increases interpretability of a model. To get this entire piece of software to run will be a little bit of a challenge since I am not wholly familiar with how to use it. I am starting with the paper this software is written for. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.016675v1.full#disp-formula-3). I plan to use the github repository and asking for guidance from it's authors to clone the repo and figure out a way to get anyone to run it in a simple, replicable way. I would create a README containing instructions on how to run it on example data, which will be much smaller than the actual data that the software is used for since otherwise it would take days to run."

    "### Part 2 Benchmark and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "&#9989;  Explain what code you are going to benchmark.  Do you know if it already can be run in parallel?  If so what types of things are you going to look for to optimize the though put of the software.  How will you evaluate the software to know if the project is successful? What do you hope/expect to deliver and a successful outcome in your final report?  For example, you plan to implement ```openmp``` and demonstrate 20 times speedup in the code or I plan to identify a bottleneck in the code and demonstrate a 4x speed up the slow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From my understanding, the problem with the SampleLASSO algorithm lies in the fact that when testing the regression, every testing sample creates a separate model of all the data, and when there is a lot of testing samples, one can imagine there is many models being created. At the moment this does not run in parallel. What I am not fully certain of yet but will understand more this weekend when I have a meeting to discuss this software in more detail is if the models depend on the previous model made. I am fairly certain that the testing models are reliant on the previous model since the model is meant to be improved in a stepwise method. Therefore while it is not currently in parallel, it may not benefit the accuracy of the overall model to do so. If I am able to demonstrate a 10x speed up in the code by implementing open_mp, I would consider it an astounding success. If openmp is unsuccessful however, or I am not able to speed it up by a significant factor, then I plan to research and apply different methods to optimize the algorithm in other ways. The overall goal is a minimum 10 time improvement in run time. If I am able to get it to run at the cost of the model's accuracy/effectivness, then I will also discuss the implications of that."

    "## What not to include (building a .gitignore file)\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing we want to teach is is that not everything should go into a git repository.  i.e. we do not want to bloat our repository with unwanted files.  The git repository works best with Text files that represent \"source\" code and not compiled or generated code. Here are some basic guidelines of what not to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```.ipynb_checkpoint``` - These folders are generated when you run jupyter notebooks.  They are \"temporary\" compiled folders that will change each time you run your notebook and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* ```__pychache__``` - Similar to .ipynb_checkpoint folders these folders are often generated when running python scripts and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Other \"Temporary\" files_** - Temporary files are generated by all types of software and often start with a special characters such as the dot (.) or the tilde (~).  For example many text editors generate temporary files to save a document in case of a program crash.  Do not include temporary files in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Compiled Code_** - Programs such as C and FORTRAN must compile their code to an executable in order to run on your computer. These compiled codes are not editable and should be left out of your repository.  Instead it is better to include instructions for compiling the source code as part of your repository.  \n",
    "* **_Program Output_** - Do not include any program output in your repository (unless for very specific reasons such as documentation, testing, or figures in your final report).  Assume that any output that can be generated by the source code should not be included with the source code (it is redundant). \n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that if you did not generate the file and/or do not know what it is you probably do NOT want to include it in your repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_WARNING_** do not blindly add all files to your repository with the * (star) syntax.  This is bad practice. For example do NOT do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git add * #THIS IS BAD!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other files to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above files it is good to avoid any type of \"Binary\" file (with a few exceptions).  As stated early, git works best with text files so it can easily track changes. Some example binary files to avoid include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Large Data files_**  Although it is good to include a few example inputs to your software, avoid using entire datasets.  It is best to store these files someplace else.  \n",
    "- **_Non-Text formats_** such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents should be avoided.  These tend to change each time they are opened even if the core text does not change. it is better to use an alternative text example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note:_** one exception to the above rules are image files (ex jpg or png) that are used to help markdown or in the documentation.  It is typically okay to include these since they tend to get included only once and do not change much as the project evolves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```.gitignore``` (typically read \"dot git ignore\") is aa text file that contains a list of regular expressions (we will learn more about these later) that specify names of files we do not want to include in a git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### .gitignore file\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```.gitignore``` (read \"dot git ignore\") file is used to help keep unwanted files out of your project.  Each line ```.gitignore``` file are filenames you want git to ignore.  For example, based on what we said above, a  good place to start on your ```.gitignore``` file would be the following two lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".ipynbcheckpoint\n",
    "__pychache__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What should go into a .gitignore depends a lot on the type of project.  However, you don't need to invent these from scratch. For example, you could just copy the .gitignore file from the course repository or find one on the internet.

    "Turns out that Jupyter notebook files and git repositories work very poorly together.  Jupyter notebook files are a unique combination of source and program generated information.  So, everytime you run a jupyter file it can add output cells which make git think you you changed something important. In many cases it is just a few numbers or some output text.  When you run the ```git status``` command it always looks like jupyter notebook files have changed even when they have not changed. \n",
