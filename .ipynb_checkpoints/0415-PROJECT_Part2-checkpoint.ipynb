    "This project is based in the domain of computational biology. It uses a customized lasso regression called Sample LASSO to impute gene expression profiles for microarray samples. The lasso algorithm is a regression analysis method that minimizes the sum of squared errors, performing both variable selection and regularization, which increases interpretability of a model.This is important for purposes in the medical field such as identifing diseases based on the gene expression profile. I picked this domain because it is one I am already familiar with, which meant that conceptually understanding the code was easier. Additionally, I picked this domain as opposed to something else because this program can make a real impact in the world. Computational science is used in biology to gain a greater understanding of the numbers and data that govern microbiology, while also providing computational methods to classify or impute data in it. What I did in this project is benchmark and test 2 different kinds of parallelization/optimization. I created benchmarks and concluded that I was able to speed the code up by about 30-40%."

    "The project is made up of 3 python scripts, 3 sbatch submission scripts. Each different parallelization method uses a separate version of all three. In total there are 3 sets of 3 python scripts/sbatch submission scripts. The methods/options implemented go as follows:\n",

What I already did is set the data used to the worm data, so you don't have to worry about changing anything. If you navigate to the main part of the repo, the entire script is run in one command. You need to change the beginning of the file name depending on your method. If you want to run in serial (original code), simply type \n",

If you want to remove that, then crtl-f search through the 3 python files and comment out any @jit/njit used in the code.) If you want to run with numba only, type in \"numba_\". \n",

After all the models are done, the knitting script will be submitted, which combines all the model data together into one array.
